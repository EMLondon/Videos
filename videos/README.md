# Style guide to EM London videos

This guide will provide stylistic standards to be adhered to when editing videos for EM London

## Resolution
The video resolution should be 1920x1080 (1080p)

## Video format
Videos should be rendered into h264

## Slides
Slides should be reformatted as 1920x1080. This will usually mean changing the aspect ratio from 4:3 to 16:9.

As a rule, the presentation file should be taken in, reformatted, and then output as PNGs or such for use in the video editing software.

### Which slides should go in?
Ask yourself: What would [Edward Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte) do? In essence, only put in slides that **enhance** the presentation, and leave slides that are redundant. For example, the following types of slides should stay:
* Title slide at the beginning of the presentation
* Illustrations that demonstrate a point
* Occasional slides that meaningfully *expand* on what the speaker has said

As a rule of thumb, if the speaker reads out a slide, it should **not** go into the video. Slides will be provided alongside the video, so viewers are always able to peruse them separately

### How can I display slides?
There are only two acceptable ways to show slides:
1. Cut to slide showing only slide
2. Slide fills entire screen with presenter video in bottom right hand corner.

## What to cut out
The overarching goal is to create a video that is compelling, professional and succinct. Any extraneous pieces should be cut.

Some specific categories to cut:
* **Banter:** Any discussion that is not relevant to the presentation. *e.g.*, "Did you guys see the game yesterday? Yeah, it was great. Moving on."
* **Insults:** Any comments directed at others that make them appear foolish, stupid, humiliated, *etc.*
* **Inappropriate pimping:** Asking questions to challenge students is fine. Asking questions that are obviously intended to make the lecturer appear smarter than the audience should be cut.
* **Bad jokes:** This is perhaps the most subjective item. If a joke is funny and timeless, it should stay. Otherwise, for the sake of preserving the dignity of the presenter, cut jokes that are dead or flop.
* **Unprofessionalism:** Any unprofessional comments should be cut.
* **Long, awkward pauses:** Occasionally there are pauses that serve no practical effect, such as when a question is asked to the audience and there is an uncomfortable silence before the speaker speaks again.
